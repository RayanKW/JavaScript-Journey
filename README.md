#I have started my journey in learning JavaScript
#
I won't be too ambitious and set timelines, 'by 2 months I will'
nonetheless I intend to seriously commit to the learning process
#
#That said then, this is a repo to document my journey, and not just to document but also
to motivate me. I have realized my productivity increases when there is a reward so when doing a task lately I am setting a reward. the reward of this is not physical or anything. It's just me telling myself I have a topic to read, write a code on it and push the code to github.
#
#Well this is the genesis I hope!
